The repository has code samples used in my 12hour live online workshop

To run these samples you need to have the current version of Node.js installed (see https://nodejs.org/en/download)

Install an IDE - either WebStorm or Visual Studio Code.

You'll also need Chrome Web browser.

The rest of the instructions are provided during the workshop.
